# The bins for the histogram may be defined by setting 3 of the following 
# 4 parameters:
#     min_sep  = the left edge of the first bin
#     max_sep  = the right edge of the last bin
#     nbins    = the number of bins

# sep_units specifies the units to use for min_sep and max_sep.
# It is also the units of R in the output file.

#gg_file_name: GGOUT

# verbose specifies how much progress output the code should emit.
# 0 = no output unless there is an error
# 1 = warnings (This is the default if not specified)
# 2 = progress information
# 3 = extra debugging output
verbose: 2

#log_file: GGLOG

# num_threads = the number of threads to use.
# The default is to let OpenMP determine an appropriate number of threads automatically.
# Usually this matches the number of cores your system has.
